                <p >Beautiful is better than ugly.<br />
                    Explicit is better than implicit.<br />
                    Simple is better than complex.<br />
                    Complex is better than complicated.<br />
                    Flat is better than nested.<br />
                    Sparse is better than dense.<br />
                    Readability counts.<br />
                    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br />
                    Although practicality beats purity.<br />
                    Errors should never pass silently.<br />
                    Unless explicitly silenced.<br />
                    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br />
                    There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.<br />
                    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br />
                    Now is better than never.<br />
                    Although never is often better than right now.<br />
                    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br />
                    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br />
                    Namespaces are one honking great idea—let's do more of those!</p >
